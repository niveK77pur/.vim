This directory has nothing to do with vim directly. This is not the
place to do vim configurations. In here you will find scripts (i.e.
bash scrips) that perform certain tasks.

The scripts that are found here are scripts meant to be called by or
for vim for the simple reason that placing the script/code directly
into the vim configuration files would be a mess or there might be
weird problems appearing.
