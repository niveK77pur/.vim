# vimrc
My personal vim configuration files. I created this repository so that I have acces to MY vim from anywhere there is internet :)

The configuration for vim needs to be put inside a `.vim` folder located inside your home directory. This is essentially a place where you put all you custom configurations.

In order for the `.vimrc` configuration file to take effect, you need to place it in the home directory. I propose you create a symbolic link in your home directory to the `$HOME/.vim/.vimrc` file. That way you have all you vim related things inside the `.vim` folder.
