# vimrc

My personal vim configuration files. I created this repository so that I have
acces to MY vim from anywhere there is internet :) But also in case something
goes wrong and I lose all my configurations (which actually happend to me ... I
actidentially deleted my whole vimrc and I was so glad I had a backup)

The configuration for vim needs to be put inside a `.vim` folder located inside
your home directory. This is essentially the place where you put all you custom
configurations.

I decided to put the `vimrc` file into the `.vim` folder. That way there is no
need to create a symbolic link to the home directory. If you were to place it in
the home directory however, don't forget to name it `.vimrc` and not `vimrc`.
Look at `:help exrc`
